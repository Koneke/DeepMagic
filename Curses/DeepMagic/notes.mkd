## Tiles and tags
Side thought, stuff like "dark" tiles in dark rooms (a la rogue), give the tile a reference to the room it is in (since dark is a room flag), and just let it dynamically return whether or not it's dark, based on whether or not the room is? Since that doesn't require the level renderer to know anything about the rooms or their flags.
